Loops:- to execute the block of the codes repeatedly.

for loop:-
-will be used when the exact iteration count is known.
syntax:- for(initialization ; condition ; updation){
    //statements
}
minimum iteration count of for loop is "0".


while:-
will be used when we don't know the  iteration count.The statement 
is printed only when the conditon is true.
syntax:- while(condition){
    //statements
}
minimum iteration count of while loop is "0".



do-while:-
will be used when we don't know the iteration count.
minimum iteration count of do-while loop is "1".
syntax:- do{
    //statements
}while(condition)

What are entry controlled and exit controlled loops.
-entry controlled loops are for and while loop.
-exit controlled loops are do-while loop.
