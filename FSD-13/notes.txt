**************************************************
- to create dynamic element in javascript we have a method called as "document.createElement()".
- to create an attributes we have a method called as "setAtttribute()".
- to remove attribute we have "removeAttribute()".

- any element which is created in javascript will not add directly to document, we have to add it 
manually by using a method called "appendChild()".
