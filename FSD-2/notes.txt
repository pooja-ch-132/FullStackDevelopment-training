Operators:-
**************
- Operators is a special type of symbols used to perform some operations on operands.
ex - 10(operand1) +(operator) 20(operand2)

- unary
- binary
- ternary(operand1 ? operand2 : operand3)

1.arithmatic Operators
2.assignment operator
3.relational operator
4.logical operator

1.arithmatic Operators:-
- addition
- substraction
- multiplication
- division
- modulus
- expoenentail
- increment(++) :- increment will happen with one value
    - pre-increment :- increment before execution
    - post-increment :- increment after execution
- decrement(--) :- decrmenrted by 1
    - pre-decrement
    - post-decrement

concatenation :- adding two or more strings.
typecasting :- converting one datatype into another datatype.
NaN :- Not a Number :- 

2.assignment operator:-
- = , += , -= , *= ,/= , %= , **=

3.relational operator
- which are used to compare two values.
- == , === , != , !== , > , >= , < , <=
- returns always a boolean.
what is the difference between "==" and "==="?
-"==" - it will check only values not a data type.
-"===" - it will check both values and data types.
- "!=" - similar to == it will check only values not a data types
- "!==" - checks both value and data types.

4.Logical operators:-
AND(&&)- when both sides condition is true then it will return true else false.
OR(||) :- when both side is true or any one side is true it will return true else false.
NOT(!):- if true it becomes false and vice-versa. 

Decision making statments:-
****************************
-if:- it will work for true statments
- if else
- else if ladder
-switch
- ternary
