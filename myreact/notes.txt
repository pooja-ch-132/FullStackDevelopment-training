JSX:-
-JSX stands for Javascript and XML.
-JSX is a javascript syntax extension used to create HTML-like markup in the react.
-Actual way to create a element in react is by using a method called as,
-React.createElement("tagname",{property:"value"}/null,content/children)
let ele = React.createElement("div",{className:"App"},
    React.createElement("h1",null,"Header")
  );

-JSX is not a part of react but it is recomended to use in react.

Rules of JSX:-
1.every element irrespective of paired/unpaired tag both must be closed.
ex:- <h1></h1>  <input/>
2.more than one jsx element is used then they must wrapped with one parent element.
ex:- <div>
<h1></h1>
<p></p>
</div>

JSX expressions:-
-JSX expression s used to call the variable, mathematical expression inside the element.
syntax:- <h1>{variable/expression}</h1>

components:-

-components are the files/modules which consists of js related logics which can be reuse.

components are divided into two types:-
1.class based components(CBC)
2.functional based components(FBC)

1.class based components(CBC):-
-CBC is similar to javascript es6 class.
-CBC are "statefull" component because of default state object present inside the class.
syntax:-
class Person{
    constructor(name, age){
        this.name=name;
        this.age=age;
    }
}

class Child extends Person{
    constructor(name, age, city){
        super(name,age);
        this.city=city;
    }
}

syntax:-
class App extends from React.Components{
    render(){
        return(
            //JSX
        )
    }
}
export default App;


2.functional based components(FBC):-
-FBC  are similar to JSX function.
-FBC are "stateless" because there is no state object untill react v16.8.

syntax:-  function App(){
    return(

    )
}
export default App;

(or)

const App=()=>{
    return(
        //JSX
    )
}
export default App;

Note:- while creating a react component the names must be started with capital letters.
-extention of a component file must be .jsx/.js
